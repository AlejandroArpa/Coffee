# SPA about coffee company

In this project, we must create a single page for a coffee company,I take the desicion to use react + vite. For run it you must have vite in your local and run the script "run dev". Is not my best work, but I do my best shoot, I have a lot of things to learn about UX and design. Also the unique feature that really use react is in the "section Staff", and only use useState hook. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
